# Backlog — work breakdown for docs/design.md

Each item is ~one PR (some split into 2–3, noted inline). Section refs (§) point
into `docs/design.md`. Items are ordered into **dependency waves**: everything in
a wave is unblocked once the prior waves land, and items *within* a wave are
mostly independent (parallelizable) — the few intra-wave dependencies are called
out with `deps:`. Each item keeps its original track tag: `[A]` protocol/controller,
`[B]` CYD logic, `[C]` UI, `[D]` hardware. `deps:` lists blocking prerequisites
(satisfied done-work omitted); "soft:" is a preferred-but-not-blocking ordering.

The spine to the MVP — **UV cure end-to-end (D5)** — is the critical path. The two
long poles are the **hardware chain D1→D2→D3→D4** and the **safety proof
A4→A8→D3** (§8 is the intended build sequence). Resolve the §10 open question
tagged to a step before starting that step's items.

## Wave 0 — Done (plumbing + first controller/logic layers)

- [x] **M0.1** [A] — Controller env + skeleton + test lane. (§3, §10, §11)
- [x] **M0.2** [A] — nanopb + TinyFrame deps + protobuf codegen step, both envs. (§9, §10)
- [x] **M0.3** [A] — `.proto` v1 + schema-hash build step (`Hello` frozen; `Recipe`/
  `Segment`, `Start`, `Heartbeat`, `Abort`, `Telemetry`, `Ack`/`Nak`, `Done`,
  `Fault` + `faultCode`). (§9, §22)
- [x] **A1** [A] — TinyFrame framing + `ISerialTransport` port + in-memory pipe. (§9)
- [x] **A2** [A] — Reliability layer: heartbeat, seq/ACK-NAK retry, session,
  schema-hash handshake gate. (§9)
  *Amended by **A8** (two bugs its host tests structurally could not see, both now pinned):
  seq restarted at 0 each boot while `SetupResponder` dedups on seq alone, so a rebooted CYD's
  first command was silently swallowed → `ReliableSender::setSeqBase()`; and `Handshake` never
  answered a `Hello`, so whoever heard first went quiet without confirming and the slower board
  never matched → per-boot `Hello.boot_nonce` + answer-on-hear. The tests hid both by booting
  both facades at the same instant. Also **A9**, which built the controller→CYD `Telemetry` half
  of §9's hot path that fell between A2 and C7.*
- [x] **A3** [A] — `HeaterActuator` time-proportioning class. (§11)

## New ports to create (not standalone items — build each with its first consumer)

Several waves depend on ports that don't exist yet. Each is one pure interface in
`lib/control_port/` (or a CYD storage port) + a `test/helpers` fake, matching the
existing `IClock`/`IHeaterSwitch` idiom:

- ~~**Temp-input** (control-sensor readback; §11 `IThermocouples`)~~ *Landed with A6:
  `lib/control_port/IThermocouples.h` (`TcReading {celsius, fault}`; `workpiece()` + a wall array
  that is both the cure control sensor and A4b's L3 high-limit input) plus `FakeThermocouples`
  (`test/helpers`). Consumed by A5/A6/A4b; the real ESP32 TC-front-end adapter is **D4**.*
- **`IContactor`** (energize-to-close; §4) — **A4a**. *Landed with A4a: `lib/control_port/IContactor.h`
  plus `FakeContactor` (`test/helpers`).*
- ~~**`IWatchdog`** (kick + reset-cause readback; §9/§11)~~ *Landed with A8:
  `lib/control_port/IWatchdog.h` (`kick()` + `ResetCause lastResetCause()`) plus `FakeWatchdog`
  (`test/helpers`) and the `Esp32Watchdog` adapter. **A4b** landed the `ResetCause`→`Fault{WATCHDOG}`
  mapping (`SafetySupervisor::noteResetCause`).*
- ~~**`IDoorSensor`** (door sense; §4/§6/§15)~~ *Landed with C8 PR3: `lib/control_port/IDoorSensor.h`
  (`isOpen()`) plus `FakeDoorSensor` (`test/helpers`) and the `Esp32DoorSensor` adapter
  (`src_control/`). Reads the donor's **DS3** dry contact — never DS1 (mains-referenced, carries the
  heater feed) nor DS2 (a sacrificial short that blows the fuse if DS1 welds). `INPUT_PULLUP` with
  the contact to GND, so a cut sense line reads OPEN and refuses to start. Consumed by
  `ControllerRunPath` (§15's safe-and-end-to-idle) and telemetry's `door_open`.*
- **Output ports** `IUvOutput` / `IFanOutput` / `IMotorOutput` (§11) — **A6** actuation wiring / **D5**.
- ~~**Storage port** (LittleFS adapter + in-memory fake; §7) — **B4**, shared by **B5**.~~
  *Landed across B5 + B4: **B5** shipped the single-blob settings half (`ISettingsStorage` +
  `FakeSettingsStorage`, `lib/storage_port`); **B4** shipped the keyed profile-blob half —
  `IProfileStorage` (`list`/`read`/`write`/`remove` by name) + `FakeProfileStorage`
  (`test/helpers`) + the `LittleFsProfileStorage` adapter (`src_cyd/`, the repo's first LittleFS
  user).*
- **SD/log sink port** (§7) — **B8**.

## Wave 1 — Ready now (deps satisfied by Wave 0)

- [x] **B2** [B] — shared rate-limit/lag math + stub `oven_cal.h` with default
  constants. deps: none. (§6, §12, §15) *New shared `lib/calibration/`: `thermal_math.h`
  (host-tested `OvenModel` + fan-conditioned rate envelopes, `rampDurationSeconds` ∫dT/rate ETA
  integral, `rateLimitRamp` feasibility, first-order `{a,b,τ}` lag, exposure↔hold, feedforward
  `steadyStateDuty`) + hand-authored `oven_cal.h` placeholders with `CALIBRATED=false` → idealized-
  linear uncalibrated preview (§12). Model threaded by arg (toy-testable; D6·tools regenerates the
  constants only). Safety constants stay in the controller header, not here (§6). Compiles into
  both firmwares (proven under `native_control`). Foundational — unblocks B1/B3/B9, A5's
  feedforward, and the ETA/preview (C7).*
- [x] **B7** [B] — fault table + latching/ack-routing logic (§22) and run-summary
  residual math (§16). deps: none. *One small PR each.*
  *PR1 (§22): `fault_table.h` (code → `{title, guidance, codeName, severity, overTemp}`) +
  `fault_controller.h` (the two-state latch: never auto-dismiss, `+N` supersede, ack-routing).
  Keys off the generated `oven_FaultCode`, so `native_logic_cyd` gained nanopb (mirroring
  `native_control`); a CYD-side copy of the enum would be the drift §9's matched-pair invariant
  exists to prevent. Operator copy lives in `app_logic`, not the view, so §22's wording is
  unit-tested — LINK_LOST's two-clause text verbatim. Both §22 trigger origins enter through
  `FaultController`; the self-raised LINK_LOST is edge-triggered + run-scoped. **Two decisions
  design.md doesn't make** (both presentation-only — the controller has already safed itself —
  and pinned by tests): the **severity order** (`severity` appears once in all of design.md with
  no order defined) HEATER_STUCK > OVERTEMP_* > SENSOR_FAULT/TC_IMPLAUSIBLE > WATCHDOG/INTERNAL/
  unknown > LINK_LOST > TARGET_UNREACHABLE/RUNTIME_EXCEEDED, so a LINK_LOST can't mask a real
  over-temp; and **HOT is chamber-specific** (OVERTEMP_CASE is the §6 electronics sensor and says
  nothing about a touchable chamber).
  PR2 (§16): `deviation_monitor.h` — ONE streaming residual channel; §15's live cue reads
  `deviating()` per tick and §16's summary reads `stats()` at Done off the same object, so
  "same residual math as the live cue" is true by construction, not by two implementations
  agreeing. dt-weighted (a mid-run rate change must not reweight the miss) and clock-free, so
  D6 can replay a log offline for identical numbers. `run_fit.h` — two channels + per-phase
  target checks → `{verdict, cause, advisory}`, implementing §16's discrimination rule
  (dirty estimator → ProjectionModel; clean estimator + missed projection → Oven). Completed
  runs only. Output is an **inline amber advisory, never the red modal** (§22). Lives in
  `app_logic`, not `calibration`: it never touches an `OvenModel` (the projection is B1/C7's
  input), the controller has no use for it, and its thresholds are hand-authored TBD §10
  constants D6's emitter must never clobber.
  Unblocks **C8**'s Fault overlay + Run Summary. All thresholds are unmeasured placeholders —
  §10 "Deviation/drift thresholds" (§8 step 4) owns them. Two items wanted a human pass; both are
  now settled. The **link-timeout ownership** question was answered by **A9**: `kLinkTimeoutMs`
  (1000 ms) is *liveness* — "is the controller still there" — while `FaultController::
  linkTimeoutMs` (2000 ms) is the separate, deliberately more patient question of when a run-scoped
  silence earns §22's red modal. Two numbers answering two questions, not one number in the wrong
  place. The **split advisory strings** have a revision drafted and awaiting review — see **S3** in
  the deferred-follow-ups sweep below.*
- [x] **C1** [C] — `NumericEntry` logic + keypad widget. deps: none. (§26)
  *Host-tested `NumericEntry` state machine (`lib/app_logic`) + on-screen keypad widget &
  view-model (`lib/ui_logic/numeric_keypad*`) with commit/cancel/clamp seams shared with C2/C8.
  Everything numeric routes through it.*
- [x] **C2** [C] — value-stepper widget. deps: none. (§24) *Shared `NumericFieldConfig`
  (`lib/app_logic`, the >20-step editor-routing rule) + the one-value-per-screen stepper
  editor (`lib/ui_logic`) with min/max disable, hold-to-accelerate, amber caution, and
  keypad/commit/cancel seams for C1/C8. Added a per-widget `red_hat_mono_28` for the big
  readout; nested `test_ui_cyd`/`test_logic_cyd` into per-suite dirs like `test_control/*`.*
- [x] **C3** [C] — Home/Status hub. deps: none. *Sets the visual language; do
  early.* (§14) Also laid the reusable MVVM UI foundation — theme tokens, shared
  `lv_subject_t` subjects, view-model/view split — and the Red Hat Mono default font.
  **Live 2026-07-18 (with A10):** the placeholder chamber temp + status dot are now driven by the
  controller's telemetry. The status badge folds run-state AND link health into one dot+word (green
  IDLE / amber RUNNING / amber HOT / red FAULT·NO LINK·SCHEMA — the separate header link readout is
  gone), and the chamber readout's digits are coloured by temperature (white < touch-safe, amber,
  red at the burn line). "HOT" is reserved for an idle chamber at/above touch-safe, so a cold
  chamber mid-run never mislabels.
- [x] **C9** [C] — sleep/wake (§17) + auto-brightness (§18). deps: none. *Ports
  `IAmbientLight`/`IBacklight` (`lib/display_port`) + host-tested `AutoBrightness`
  (filter→curve→additive-bias→hysteresis→ramp→floor/ceiling; sole backlight owner) and
  `SleepController` (idle-only, wake-tap consumed, never sleep non-idle) in `lib/app_logic`;
  ESP32 adapters + `main.cpp` wiring with live bias preview. Curve calibrated + inverted for
  this board's LDR (GPIO34 reads ~0 in room light, climbs in the dark). Verified on hardware.
  Door-open wake deferred until the controller reports door state over telemetry (§9).*
  **Extended 2026-07-18 (with A10):** the sleep gate now shares one predicate with the idle dot
  (`HomeViewModel::atRest`) — the screen may sleep only when idle AND touch-safe, stays awake during
  a run (which also keeps the heartbeat alive) or while the chamber is hot, and a sleeping screen
  relights if the chamber climbs past touch-safe. Door-open wake still waits on the door sensor.
- [x] **A7** [A] — controller-side recipe validation: range checks,
  mode-from-content derivation, NAK reasons (plugs into A2's `ISetupValidator`
  seam). deps: A2. (§4, §9)
  *Host-tested `RecipeValidator` (`lib/control_logic`) implementing `protocol::ISetupValidator`:
  structural + range checks and the §4 content-derived cap selector (any `uv`/`motor` segment
  forces the cure ceiling; a REFLOW-tagged recipe containing them is NAKed), against the
  hand-written `oven_safety.h`. The untrusted `mode` tag is cross-checked, never trusted to pick
  the cap. **Two NAK reasons remain deferred**: `NAK_WORKPIECE_TC_INVALID` (needs the temp-input
  port) and `NAK_ILLEGAL_TRANSITION` (needs A6's run state). Two §10 opens still bear on it — the
  UV/cure absolute ceiling (`CURE_HARD_MAX_C` is a TBD placeholder, gating §8 step 3) and D1's
  fan-motor decision, which fixes the `Segment` fan field's domain.*
  ***COMPLETED 2026-07-21 by the deferred-follow-ups sweep, which also found that A7 was never
  actually running.*** *`RecipeValidator` was host-tested and never passed to `ControllerLink`, so
  the controller firmware ran the `AcceptAllValidator` default: on real hardware §4's layer-1
  untrusted-CYD backstop was not executing at all, and any recipe the CYD sent was Acked whatever
  its setpoints. (A4b's supervisor still clamped and tripped on **measured** temperature, so this
  was a missing layer rather than no protection — but the layer is the point, and an upload-time
  Nak tells the operator why where a runtime trip only alarms.) Wiring it forced a reordering of
  `src_control/main.cpp`: `ControllerLink` takes its validator at construction with no setter, and
  the validator reads the executor + temp source, so both now precede the link stack.
  Both deferred NAK reasons landed with it — their blockers arrived with **A6** — and each mirrors a
  gate the CYD already applies in Confirm (§19), which §4/§9 require the controller to hold without
  trusting: `NAK_ILLEGAL_TRANSITION` (a Start while the executor is RUNNING, read off
  `ProfileExecutor` rather than pushed per-loop, since a cached flag could be a tick stale exactly
  when it decides) and `NAK_WORKPIECE_TC_INVALID` (a REFLOW-**content** Start whose probe is not
  attached and reading like the load). The plausibility predicate moved into a shared
  `lib/calibration/workpiece_tc.h` — the `touch_safe.h` treatment — because two copies would drift
  into a Start the CYD offers and the controller then refuses, a dead button with no explanation.
  **Behaviour change:** production `esp32dev_control` runs `StubThermocouples` (every channel
  faulted) until **D4**, so it now refuses every reflow Start. Fail-closed and correct — the stub's
  own comment notes a run armed against it would trip `SENSOR_FAULT` immediately — but visible. The
  sim build supplies readings, so the bench is unaffected. Both guards are inert when their source
  is null, which keeps every bare `RecipeValidator v;` behaving as before. `fuzz_validator` now
  drives an adversarial `FakeThermocouples` + a live executor off the same input bytes (11.1M runs
  clean).*
- [ ] **D1** [D] — §10 teardown verifications (one investigation task): fan motor
  type, cooling-fan existence, SMPS reuse, humidity-sensor interface, relay board.
  deps: hardware access. *Gates the `Recipe` schema details, the drivers, and all
  of Track D.* (§6, §10)

## Wave 2 — Controller run path + CYD data/store (build on Wave 1 + new ports)

- [x] **A4a** [A] — `SafetySupervisor`: command-timeout + fail-safe defaults +
  contactor policy. deps: A2, A3; new `IContactor`. (§4, §9)
  *Host-tested `SafetySupervisor` (`lib/control_logic`): sole owner of the heater safety-cutoff
  and mains contactor; drives fail-safe (heater OFF, contactor open) on construction and cuts on
  the next tick whenever `ControllerLink::authorized()` drops (pulled TX, reboot, enable-low,
  schema skew, stale >750 ms). Contactor is energize-to-close, closed only while authorized. New
  `IContactor` port + `FakeContactor`. A minimal `trip()`/`clearFault()` latch is the seam A4b's
  L3 clamps and the A6/A7 fault paths hook into (no `FaultCode`/`Fault` emission yet). The
  command-timeout test is the unit-level form of A8's §8-step-1 fail-safe proof. ESP32 adapters +
  `main.cpp` wiring deferred to A8.*
- [x] **A4b** [A] — `SafetySupervisor` L3: setpoint clamp, per-mode over-temp trip,
  stuck-heater plausibility, bounded total runtime, reset-cause → `Fault{WATCHDOG}`.
  deps: A4a, temp-input port, `IWatchdog`; soft: B2 (runtime bound uses `oven_cal`). (§4)
  *Extended `SafetySupervisor` (now `IThermocouples` + `IClock`-injected) with the L3 layer that
  acts on **measured** temp, so it catches a welded SSR the setpoint clamp can't. `armRun(recipe)`
  derives the cap-selector mode from recipe **content** (reusing `oven_safety::deriveMode`) and,
  while armed + authorized, every tick checks: per-mode over-temp trip on an **independent
  high-limit channel** (the hottest non-faulted wall — §4's "own channel, not the control
  sensor"; no knowledge of which channel the executor uses); stuck-heater (measured rise while
  commanded `duty ≈ 0` across a window, off `HeaterActuator::duty()`); bounded runtime; and a
  refuse-to-run-blind `SENSOR_FAULT` when no wall channel is usable. The supervisor is now the
  single fault **aggregator/latch**: the executor's `Output.fault` routes in via a new
  `trip(code)` overload, the L3 checks trip internally, and `faultCode()` exposes the one active
  code. **The runtime bound sidesteps the soft B2 dep**: B1 already baked projected durations into
  `dur_ms`, so the budget is Σ`dur_ms` × margin — summed in 64-bit and saturated to uint32 so a
  raw/adversarial recipe can't overflow it — with no `oven_cal`. `clampSetpoint()` is a **total**
  independent clamp (NaN/±Inf → finite, ≤ hard-max), defense-in-depth over the executor's own.
  Watchdog reset → `Fault{WATCHDOG}` via `noteResetCause()` — **annunciation, not a latch**, since
  the controller already boots safe.
  **Built the controller-side Fault-emit path that didn't exist** (only heartbeat/telemetry
  senders did): new `protocol::FaultSender` mirroring `TelemetrySender` — fires the dedicated
  `Fault` frame on change and re-sends while active so a dropped, un-ACKed frame self-heals; the
  CYD latches on first receipt so repeats are harmless. `telemetry.fault_code` rides continuously
  as the backup channel. This finally gives **B7's `FaultController` a live producer** (§22 modal),
  closing the controller→CYD annunciation pipeline end-to-end (still C8's to render).
  **A4b-shaped fuzzing** joins A5/A6's harnesses: `fuzz/fuzz_safety_supervisor.cpp` drives a raw
  recipe + adversarial driver (temps incl. NaN/Inf, duty, clock jumps, auth/trip/clear) and asserts
  the L3 invariants — latch monotonicity, trip ⇒ safe, `clampSetpoint` totality, run-blind refusal,
  and no UB in `armRun`'s Σ — clean over millions of runs.
  **On-device temp source is deferred to D4** (a `StubThermocouples` reporting no channel; the L3
  checks only run once a run is armed, which rides in with D4's real sensor) — the same
  "logic host-tested, hardware wiring deferred" posture A4a took to A8. **All L3 thresholds are
  §10-open placeholders** (over-temp margin, stuck-heater rise/window, runtime frac) — the §10
  "over-temp-trip / stuck-heater margins + times" item owns them, tuned against real runs (§8 step
  4). Host-tested (`test_safety_supervisor` +10 cases, `test_fault_sender`).*
- [x] **A5** [A] — PID + anti-windup + feedforward hook, tested against a toy
  first-order plant. deps: A3, temp-input port; soft: B2 (feedforward constants). (§5)
  *New `lib/control_logic/heater_control.h`: class `HeaterControl` (PI + an inert D seam),
  conditional-integration anti-windup, and the feedforward-duty hook B2's `steadyStateDuty` feeds.
  Depends only on `IClock`; `update(setpointC, measuredC, ffDuty)` returns a duty clamped to
  `[dutyMin, dutyMax]`, `reset()` clears the integrator. A non-finite (faulted-TC) measurement maps
  to OFF — the loop refuses to control blind. Gains (`kp=0.02, ki=0.002, kd=0`) are §10 placeholders.
  Host-tested against a toy first-order plant (`test_heater_control`) plus a
  `fuzz/fuzz_heater_control.cpp` invariant harness (duty stays in range under adversarial
  gains/trajectories incl. NaN/Inf). **Not yet in the live loop** — the ProfileExecutor→PID→heater
  wiring in `main.cpp` rides in with D4's real temp source (the same logic-tested/hardware-deferred
  posture A4a took to A8, and A4b to D4).*
- [x] **A6** [A] — profile executor: segment sequencing, `RAMP_ASAP` target
  gating, hold-entry gate, per-segment watchdog. deps: temp-input port. *Emits the
  setpoint A5's PID tracks — buildable/testable independently of A5.* (§5)
  *New `lib/control_logic/profile_executor.h`: class `ProfileExecutor`, the run engine that walks an
  accepted `oven_Recipe` and each tick emits `{setpointC, channel states, segIdx, runState, fault,
  safe}` — the setpoint A5 tracks and the `safe`/`fault` seam into `SafetySupervisor::trip()` (A4b).
  Implements the three interps (RAMP_OVER_TIME sweep, RAMP_ASAP target-gated advance, HOLD with the
  reflow hold-entry gate vs the cure dose timer) and the per-segment watchdog (k×projected-dur,
  measured-rate floor, absolute stall cap → `TARGET_UNREACHABLE`) whose constants are §10
  placeholders. Mode-agnostic by construction — the caller selects the control sensor (workpiece in
  reflow, wall in cure). Robust to a raw, pre-validation recipe: non-finite `heat_c` and
  out-of-range `interp` are handled without UB (`interp` read via `protocol::wireEnum`), and the
  emitted setpoint is always finite and clamped to the recipe's own max. **Also shipped the
  temp-input port** this, A5, and A4b share: `IThermocouples` (`lib/control_port`) + `FakeThermocouples`.
  Host-tested (`test_profile_executor`) + a `fuzz/fuzz_executor.cpp` liveness harness (the run always
  leaves RUNNING under any recipe + trajectory). `main.cpp` wiring deferred to D4 as with A5.*
- [x] **B1** [B] — phase→segment compiler: {target, ramp `x`, hold `y`} → generic
  segments; two-tier validation; exposure→hold-seconds math with fallback/labeling.
  deps: B2. (§5, §12)
  *New `lib/app_logic/`: `phase.h` (the editable domain model — `FanMode {Auto,On,Off}` tri-state,
  `RecipeMode`, the `Phase` struct — kept apart from the compiler because C5's editor mutates it),
  `recipe_compiler.h` (`compileRecipe()` lowering a `Phase[]` into an `oven_Recipe`), and B3's
  `fan_resolver.h` (below). Each phase → a ramp segment (`RAMP_OVER_TIME` when x>0, `RAMP_ASAP` when
  x=0 with dur estimated via `rampDurationSeconds` for the ETA/watchdog) + a hold; a degenerate ramp
  (no temperature change) or a hold rounding to 0 ms is omitted — the latter matters because the
  controller NAKs `dur_ms==0`, so every emitted segment carries dur>0. Cure holds compute from
  UV-exposure-per-surface via `beamCoverage`, falling back to raw seconds when the turntable is off
  or there is no coverage, and are labeled estimated when uncalibrated. **Two-tier validation
  (§12):** a *hard* tier that is a strict subset of the controller's `RecipeValidator` (A7) — ≥1
  phase, targets finite + within the passed-in caps, reflow-tag/content consistency, ≤32 segments —
  so an accepted compile never NAKs on upload; and an *amber* tier (rate-limited ramps,
  estimated/fallback holds, heuristic fans, whole-recipe uncalibrated preview) that only warns —
  those stay saveable/uploadable and take their real time via the controller's hold-entry gate. Caps
  and the `OvenModel` are passed by argument (no policy in the compiler), matching `thermal_math.h`.
  Host-tested (`test_recipe_compiler`, 11 cases) **plus a differential fuzz harness**
  (`fuzz/fuzz_compiler.cpp`, env `fuzz_compiler`) asserting every hard-valid compile is accepted by
  the real `RecipeValidator` — 10M+ runs clean; the fuzz suite's README was reframed as the repo's
  property-fuzz home (untrusted-input + internal-correctness families) as part of this. Unblocks
  **C5** (editor/preview), **B6**, **B9**.*
- [x] **B3** [B] — fan-`Auto` resolver at recipe-compile time + pre-calibration
  heuristic fallback. deps: B2. (§5) *Shipped with B1 as `lib/app_logic/fan_resolver.h`:
  `resolveFans()` turns each phase's tri-state `FanMode` into the resolved on/off the compiled
  Recipe carries (no `Auto` crosses the wire, §9). Explicit On/Off pass through; `Auto` consults the
  fan-conditioned envelopes — conv on when the fan-off heat envelope can't meet the requested ramp,
  cool on when passive cooling is too slow, faster-envelope wins for ASAP — and before calibration
  falls back to the §5 heuristic (conv on while heating, cool on while cooling), flagged so the
  preview labels it estimated. The exact rate/target margins stay §10-open (`kRampMarginFrac`
  placeholder). Host-tested (`test_fan_resolver`).*
- [x] **B4** [B] — `ProfileStore` over a storage port; per-mode dirs;
  stock-vs-user semantics. deps: storage port. (§7, §23)
  **RE-HOMED 2026-07-17 (Wave R2):** the store + port move CYD → controller
  (`lib/control_logic`), storing `oven_Profile`; the CYD becomes a remote client (R3).
  The store logic/tests below are reused near-verbatim, just on the other board.
  *New keyed profile-storage port `IProfileStorage` (`lib/storage_port`) — the multi-entry sibling
  of B5's single-blob `ISettingsStorage` (list/read/write/remove a blob **by name**; the store owns
  the byte layout, the adapter stays dumb) — plus `FakeProfileStorage` (`test/helpers`) and the
  `LittleFsProfileStorage` firmware adapter (`src_cyd/`, one instance per mode dir, the repo's first
  LittleFS user). Host-tested `ProfileStore` (`lib/app_logic`), one instance per mode, mirrors
  `SettingsStore` structurally: it is the **first serialization of the `Phase[]` domain model** as a
  versioned `PersistedBlob` (magic `"PRO1"`, `name` + `mode` + `Phase[]`), with `list`/`load`/`save`/
  `delete`/`duplicate`. Enforces the two decisions design.md leaves to the store: the §23 **stock
  read-only rule** (stock-ness is a **blob flag**, not a directory split — matching §7's single-dir
  phrasing — and save-over/delete of a stock entry are refused, `duplicate` clears the flag) and the
  §7 **never-mixed guard at the store** (a blob whose `mode` byte isn't this store's — a cross-mode
  WiFi upload landing in the wrong dir — is ignored by list/load, not just kept apart by the
  directory). The deserializer is **hardened against untrusted input** (a profile can be pushed over
  serial/WiFi without a reflash, §7): a malformed/short/bad-magic/wrong-version blob is rejected
  never mis-parsed, `phaseCount` is bounded to `kMaxPhases`, the name is always NUL-terminated, and
  `validName` bars path separators / control bytes / `.`/`..` / over-length before any name reaches
  an adapter. **`kMaxPhases` moved `recipe_compiler.h` → `phase.h`** (the Phase-domain fact, so the
  persistence layer needn't pull in the compiler/protobuf; the compiler now `static_assert`s it
  against `kMaxSegments`). `main.cpp` mounts LittleFS at boot and instantiates the two per-mode
  stores as live production wiring (a boot log exercises the whole store→adapter→LittleFS stack);
  the library/editor **screens that drive them are C4/C5**. Host-tested (`test_profile_store`,
  11 cases) **plus a `fuzz/fuzz_profile_store.cpp` harness** (untrusted-blob robustness + a
  save→load round-trip + a "a loaded profile is always a valid `compileRecipe` input" differential
  tying into `fuzz_compiler`) — 11M+ runs clean. **Deferred** (noted in §7/§23, not built here): the
  `data/`-JSON→`uploadfs` stock-seed population + the §24 "Restore stock profiles" action (need a
  seed source — land with C4 / deployment) and recently-used sort ordering (needs a usage clock the
  store doesn't own — `list()` returns a deterministic alphabetical base and C4's ViewModel
  re-sorts). Unblocks **C4** (profile library list/detail) → **C6** (Setup loads a profile as a
  template).
- [x] **B5** [B] — `SettingsStore` + per-field `{min, max, step, units}` config +
  boot-time clamp-to-hard-max. deps: storage port (share B4's). (§4, §24)
  **RE-HOMED 2026-07-17 (Wave R2):** the store + port move CYD → controller; the CYD
  reads/writes via a `SettingsClient` over the link (R3). Bonus: the per-mode caps now
  live on the safety MCU, resolving the §4 defense-in-depth open.
  *`ISettingsStorage` port (`lib/storage_port`) + host-tested `SettingsStore` (`lib/app_logic`):
  versioned blob, load-time re-clamp to current bounds, `NumericFieldConfig`-driven validation
  shared with the numeric editors. NVS/Preferences adapter is thin `src_cyd/` glue. Shipped the
  C8 Settings hub/panels slice (`settings_screen.*`) alongside.*
- [ ] **B8·1** [B] — SD logging PR1: length-delimited protobuf writer + header
  record. deps: SD port. (§7)

## Wave 3 — Bench safety proof, screens, generators (compose Wave 2)

- [x] **A8** [A] — bench `Esp32*` adapters + dummy-load firmware: heartbeat-pull
  test with an LED "heater" shuts off within the timeout. **Closes §8 step 1.**
  deps: A4a, two dev boards (no oven). *A5/A6/A7 enrich a real bench run but aren't
  needed for the fail-safe proof itself.*
  *Proven on two dev boards, no oven: **the heater output dies 745–756 ms after the heartbeats
  stop**, against `kCommandTimeoutMs` = 750 (measured over 4 trials via an edge-triggered bench
  log; the 1 Hz trace is far too coarse to tell a real timeout from a lucky guess). New
  `src_control/` adapters — `Esp32SerialTransport`, `Esp32HeaterSwitch` (GPIO25), `Esp32Contactor`
  (GPIO26), `Esp32Watchdog`, `Esp32Clock` promoted out of `main.cpp` — injected into the A1–A4a
  logic **unchanged**: both `main.cpp`s are recognizable mirrors of `test_reliability_integration`'s
  `Rig`, so `main()` really is the only divergence from the host tests (§11). Both firmwares now
  pump `FrameLink::poll()`/`tick()` from their own loop (neither facade's `service()` does), on a
  fixed 10 ms cadence because TinyFrame's resync timeout counts **`tick()` calls, not ms**.
  **Decision: a bench-only `CONTROL_BENCH` build moves the controller's link to UART2** — §2 pins
  production to UART0 for §25's ROM loader, but that is also the devkit's USB-bridge port, and a
  powered bridge idles TX *driven high*, so it wins arbitration outright (a series resistor only
  picks the loser). The flag therefore also decides whether a **console exists at all**: production
  has none, since the link owns `Serial` — `TF_Error`'s printf is compiled out (`TF_ERROR_QUIET`)
  for the same reason, and both are verified by grepping the built `.elf` rather than trusted.
  **Bench duty stub** (`authorized ? 0.5 : 0`): `SafetySupervisor` only ever cuts and A5's PID does
  not exist, so nothing would raise duty and the LED could never light; at `windowMs=1000` that is a
  500 ms blink = "authorized **and** the loop is alive", while the contactor LED (driven by the
  supervisor itself) is the true `authorized()` readout. `Esp32SerialTransport::write` deliberately
  does **not** clamp to `availableForWrite()`: `TF_WriteImpl` discards the returned count, so a
  short write truncates a frame with no resume path — non-blocking comes from sizing the TX ring
  above `TF_SENDBUF_LEN` instead. CYD link plumbing landed **unconditionally** (it is production
  wiring, and a `session=0`/`enable=false` sender authorizes nothing), with only the boot-time
  Recipe+Start+`HEAT_EN` stimulus behind `esp32dev_cyd_bench`; §19/C6 owns starting a run.
  ***That stimulus was DELETED 2026-07-20*** *(with the two CYD `_bench` envs and the
  `CYD_BENCH_LINK` flag, which gated nothing else): it started a cure on CYD boot, so plugging the
  CYD in energized the heater with no Confirm hold — found on the bench when a replug ran the
  element unattended. It also made step 1's own "or the CYD reboots" clause untestable, since the
  cut fired and the stimulus re-armed heat ~5 s later. A8's proof stands (the cut is what it
  measured); the two-devkit bench now pairs a controller bench/sim build with the ORDINARY CYD
  firmware and runs start from Confirm. See §19's guarantee-boundary note and §8 step 2. Verifying
  that deletion also surfaced **A11** (a run nothing ever ends when the peer vanishes).*
  **Three bugs the bench found that the host tests could not**, all fixed here with regression
  coverage: (1) **`SetupResponder` dedups on seq alone while `ReliableSender` restarts seq at 0
  each boot**, so a rebooted CYD's `Start{seq=1}` was read as a replay — Acked, but
  `onStartAccepted` never fired and the session was silently never adopted; fixed with
  `ReliableSender::setSeqBase()`, seeded from `esp_random()` per boot. (2) **`Handshake` never
  answered a `Hello`**, and *hearing* a peer is not *being heard* — whoever heard first went quiet
  without confirming, so the CYD (~3 s slower to boot) sat at `sawPeer=0` while the controller read
  `matched=1`, and a lone controller reset left it `matched=0` forever. That defeated §9's *decided*
  re-sync and would have made **every watchdog reset take the link down permanently**. Fixed by
  appending a per-boot `boot_nonce` to `Hello` (append-only, so the frozen contract holds) and
  answering a received Hello — immediately on a new/changed nonce, else at most once per
  `kHelloRetryMs`; the rate limit is what makes it terminate, since an answer is never "new" to a
  peer that already knows us. The host tests hid this by having both facades `begin()` at the same
  instant. (3) design.md §11 said `SafetySupervisor.tick()` runs **first** each loop — wrong on the
  merits, since the PID's later `setDuty()` would overwrite `forceOff()` and re-latch a nonzero
  window, losing safety to the PID for a full second; corrected to **last**. New `test_bench_link`
  suite composes `test_reliability_integration`'s two-facade rig with A4a's output stack — the
  first coverage of "real frames stop → the **output** actually cuts" (`test_safety_supervisor`
  reaches into `gate()` directly; `test_reliability_integration` owns no outputs). **§8 step 1's
  three clauses all close:** outputs-default-OFF (controller alone holds `safe=1` indefinitely),
  command-timeout (above), and **watchdog** — a bench hang trigger proves the reset really fires
  and the next boot reports `ResetCause::Watchdog`, which also confirmed that subscribing the task
  by hand (rather than Arduino's `enableLoopWDT()`, whose wrapper would auto-feed the dog) is what
  makes the kick mean anything. **Not in scope:** `Fault{WATCHDOG}` *emission* stays A4b's (A4a
  deferred all FaultCode plumbing) — A8 only logs the cause on the bench. No UV/fan/motor ports
  (A6 owns the logic that would drive them). No PID (A5) — hence the duty stub. **A8 proves the
  cut, not a latch:** restoring the wire re-authorizes on its own, which is correct — A4b's
  `trip()` is what makes a fault sticky. The bench pinout is not production's, so link-on-UART0
  must be re-verified before §25; §8 step 2's re-run against the real chain is where that lands.*
- [x] **A9** [A] — controller→CYD `Telemetry` hot path + CYD-side link health. deps: A2, A8.
  (§9, §14)
  *The half of §9's hot path nobody owned: A2 built the CYD→controller `Heartbeat`, C7 owns
  *consuming* telemetry for the Run screen, and emitting it fell between them — so the link was
  one-way and **the CYD had no way to know the controller existed**. Found the way it had to be:
  the Home indicator kept reading "Link" with the controller physically unplugged. `matched()`
  cannot fill that gap — it answers a different question ("did a peer once answer, and do we
  agree on the `.proto`") and it **latches**. New `protocol::TelemetrySender` mirroring
  `HeartbeatSender` (fire-on-tick, no retransmit — a lost frame self-heals), emitting at §9's
  decided 250 ms **unconditionally, run or no run**, per §9's "unconditionally sends Hello + IDLE
  telemetry". The caller owns the payload via `state()`; the sender only stamps
  session/seq/ctrl_millis and owns the cadence, so it stays ignorant of what telemetry *means* —
  today the controller emits an otherwise-zeroed IDLE frame carrying `heater_duty`, read **after**
  `SafetySupervisor::tick()` so it reports what the outputs actually did rather than what the
  control loop asked for; A5/A6/D4 fill in the rest. `CydLink::linkAlive()` reads *arrival* (not
  contents) as the liveness proof. **New `kLinkTimeoutMs = 1000`** (~4 missed frames — the same
  "miss 3-4 and act" logic as `kCommandTimeoutMs`, in the other direction); deliberately **not**
  the same number as `FaultController::linkTimeoutMs` = 2000, which is a separate, more patient
  run-scoped choice about when to throw a red modal (§22). Both are **TBD §10** placeholders.
  `HomeViewModel::linkStateFrom` gained an `alive` input and consults it **first**, since it is
  the only one that decays; `saw_peer`/`matched` still distinguish "check the cable" from
  "reflash the pair", which must never collapse into one state. **`HeartbeatMonitor` moved
  `lib/control_logic` → `lib/protocol`** (+ `namespace protocol`): both ends ask the identical
  question of the other's hot-path stream — `SessionGate` of `Heartbeat` at `kCommandTimeoutMs`,
  `CydLink` of `Telemetry` at `kLinkTimeoutMs` — so one implementation now serves both directions
  instead of `lib/protocol` reaching up into `control_logic`. B7's `FaultController` still
  deliberately reuses the *pattern* rather than the class (it owns no clock port); its comment was
  updated, not its reasoning. Also added `HeaterActuator::duty()` so telemetry can report the
  post-safety truth. **Unblocks** §22's `FaultController.linkHealthy`, which B7 left as a
  parameter with no producer. Door-open wake (§17) still waits on D1/D3 — the transport exists
  now, the sensor doesn't. Verified on the bench: holding the controller in reset reads
  `matched=1 sawPeer=1 alive=0 state=LINK_NONE` — the latch and the decay disagreeing, exactly as
  intended — and it recovers on its own when telemetry resumes.*
- [x] **A10** [A] — physical-oven plant simulator for bench testing with the real
  controller. A thermal-plant model — heater duty → wall/workpiece temperature via the
  shared first-order envelopes + lag (reuse `thermal_math.h` / `oven_cal.h` so the sim and
  the planner/preview agree), passive cooling (no chamber cool fan, §6), plus convection-fan
  and UV/turntable effects — that consumes the controller's output commands and feeds back
  **synthetic thermocouple readings**, closing the control loop with no oven. Lets the full
  run path be exercised end-to-end against the real controller firmware on the two-devkit
  bench (A8) before mains hardware (D3/D4) exists: the executor's segment sequencing +
  `RAMP_ASAP`/hold-entry gating (A6), the PID + feedforward (A5), the safety supervisor's
  clamps/trips (A4a/A4b), and the implicit **backup cooldown to touch-safe** (§5/§6) — e.g.
  drive a reflow profile and watch it ramp, soak, peak, then coast to 43 °C and report DONE.
  Form to decide: a controller-side fake `IThermocouples` adapter that runs the plant model
  on-device from the commanded outputs (loop closes entirely on the controller, host reads
  telemetry), and/or a host/second-devkit plant node — pick during design; keep the model in
  `lib/` (host-testable, board-agnostic) with only the injection adapter board-specific.
  deps: A5, A6, A8. (§5, §6, §8 step 1)
  **DONE 2026-07-18.** Form chosen (with the user): a **physics twin + back-fit cal**
  (first-principles lumped-capacitance model, then linearized into `oven_cal.h` so the sim and
  the CYD preview/ETA agree by construction), running **on-device + host** (real firmware via
  `CONTROL_SIM`, plus a host closed-loop harness), with **physics-anchored** constants (the donor
  is assumed faulty, so no measured heat-up data). Landed: `lib/plant/oven_plant.h` (energy model —
  loss-limited ceiling, asymptotic cooling, element overshoot) + `lib/plant/sim_thermocouples.h`
  (an `IThermocouples` backed by the plant, with quantization + open/short fault injection);
  `lib/control_logic/run_path.h` — the first composition of executor + PID + safety + heater into
  one tick sequence, which D4 reuses (and which surfaced a real bug: an executor fault wasn't
  reaching the supervisor); `oven_cal.h` re-authored physics-anchored (`CALIBRATED` stays false);
  `esp32dev_control_sim` env; `test_oven_plant` + a cal-consistency test, the closed-loop
  `test_sim_run`, and `fuzz_oven_plant` / `fuzz_sim_run` (plant robustness + whole-run
  safety/liveness/cooldown invariants). Bench-verified end-to-end on the two-devkit rig: a cure
  profile ramped → held → coasted to 43 °C → reported **DONE** (fault=0). Follow-on the same day:
  the CYD Home screen was wired to the sim's telemetry (temp-driven status badge + readout colours,
  sleep gating), and the touch-safe temperature was unified into one shared
  `lib/calibration/touch_safe.h` (`oven_domain::kTouchSafeC`).
- [x] **A11** [A] — end an **orphaned run** to IDLE when the peer is lost or reboots.
  deps: A4a, A6, A10 (the run path). (§9, §15)
  *Found on the bench 2026-07-21 while verifying the A8-stimulus deletion: the supervisor cuts the
  outputs at `kCommandTimeoutMs` as designed, but **nothing ends the run** — the executor keeps
  advancing its clock and setpoint with `duty=0`, and telemetry keeps advertising `RUNNING`. A
  freshly booted CYD then renders a run nobody started and that is not heating (observed: Home
  showing `run_state=1` against a controller reading `authorized=0 safe=1`).
  **Why ending it is right, not just tidy:** §15's resume (B6) is driven by the CYD's own
  `RunTracker` — how far the hold got, what remainder to generate — and that state does not survive
  a CYD reboot. A run orphaned that way is unrecoverable **by construction**, so keeping it RUNNING
  holds no door open for recovery; it only misleads. It also composes with B6 rather than fighting
  it: when the CYD is alive and only the cable glitched, the controller ending its run is exactly
  the precondition for §15's normal resume (the CYD re-Starts a generated remainder as a new
  session).
  **Shape:** a second clause in `ControllerRunPath::tick()` beside the door check (step 0) — same
  place, same argument, and it keeps `SafetySupervisor`'s "only ever cuts" invariant (A4a) intact:
  ending a run is bookkeeping, the mitigation already happened. **Two triggers**, deliberately:
  a changed peer `boot_nonce` (A8 put it in `Hello` and the handshake already watches it) ends the
  run **immediately** — positive evidence the operator's context is gone rather than mere silence,
  and the exact case that produces the phantom; and sustained non-authorization past a new
  `orphanTimeoutMs` covers cable-pulled / CYD-unpowered, where no nonce ever arrives. Then
  `exec_.abort()` + `SessionGate::clearSession()` (which already exists for precisely "run
  ended/aborted/faulted → IDLE-safe") + a latched edge for telemetry, mirroring `doorAborted()`.
  **Must NOT break:** a same-session reconnect inside the window legitimately resumes the run —
  `authorized()` returns and the supervisor stops cutting — which is the right answer to a brief
  glitch and is existing behaviour. Only a **rebooted** CYD cannot do this (it draws a fresh
  `esp_random()` session, so the old one is unreachable forever).
  **Not a fault** (§22 excludes it, as with the door): no modal, no latch, just IDLE + a telemetry
  bit. B7's CYD-side run-scoped `LINK_LOST` already covers what an operator who was *present* needs.
  **§10-open:** `orphanTimeoutMs` — must be ≫ `kCommandTimeoutMs` (750 ms) so dropped frames never
  end a run; ~30 s is the starting placeholder. **Structural:** `ControllerRunPath` gains an
  `IClock` (it has none today).
  **Tests:** `test_run_path` — same-session reconnect inside the window keeps the run and resumes
  duty (the behaviour that must not regress); silence past the window leaves RUNNING with duty 0,
  no fault latched, session cleared; a new peer nonce ends it immediately; telemetry then reads
  IDLE. Extend `fuzz_sim_run`'s link churn with "no run outlives its session by more than
  `orphanTimeoutMs`".
  **Known objection:** a reflow run ended by a 30 s glitch — but its outputs were off for those
  30 s, so the profile is already ruined; ending it honestly and letting §16's summary say so beats
  pretending it continued.*
  **DONE 2026-07-21.** Shipped exactly as shaped: a second clause in `ControllerRunPath::tick()`
  beside the door check ends the run on either a changed peer `boot_nonce` (immediate) or sustained
  non-authorization past `ControllerRunPath::kOrphanTimeoutMs` (30 s placeholder, `static_assert`ed
  `> 10× kCommandTimeoutMs`) via `exec_.abort()` + `link_.gate().clearSession()` + an `orphanAborted()`
  latch — **not** a `SafetySupervisor::trip()` (§22 excludes it). The run path gained an `IClock`
  (rippled to all four construction sites); `main.cpp` pushes an immediate telemetry frame on the
  orphan edge so a fresh CYD reads IDLE at once. **No proto/schema change** — the run-state→IDLE
  transition is the signal, so the "telemetry bit" is the state itself rather than a new field. Three
  `test_run_path` cases (same-session reconnect keeps the run; silence past the window ends it, no
  fault, session cleared; new nonce ends it immediately) + a `fuzz_sim_run` authorization-churn axis
  and the "no run outlives its last authorized tick by > `kOrphanTimeoutMs`" invariant (24k+ runs
  clean). Incidental: `fuzz/corpus/run_tracker/` was missing its committed seeds, breaking
  `make fuzz-corpus` for every harness after it — added `_cure`/`_reflow` seeds (same shared-shaped
  format as `profile_facts`). **Bench-confirmed** on the two-devkit sim rig: a run armed from Confirm,
  the CYD unplugged mid-run, and the controller stopped the run — the A11 behaviour end-to-end.
  (Caveat noted for future bench work: opening the controller's USB port toggles DTR/RTS and reboots
  it, so live serial monitoring perturbs run-state; a single continuous monitor avoids repeated
  resets. Also: hot-unplugging the CYD mid-run brown-out-corrupted its app flash and needed a
  reflash — a bench hazard, unrelated to this controller-side change.)*
- [x] **C4** [C] — profile library (list + detail). deps: B4, C3. (§23)
  **REWIRED 2026-07-17 (Wave R3):** the view-model binds to a `ProfileClient` (remote,
  over the link) instead of a local `ProfileStore`, gaining loading/error states; the
  curve/facts math stays CYD-side, fed by the fetched `Profile`.
  *Shipped as a self-contained hub-and-spoke controller (the `SettingsScreen` pattern): Home →
  Profiles opens a **Cure|Reflow chooser** — **two big Home-style tiles** ("UV CURE PROFILES" /
  "REFLOW PROFILES"), a direct tap rather than a menu since there are only two profile types (the
  entry is mode-blind; §23's "never mixed" is enforced by picking a mode first) — then the fixed-mode
  **list** → profile **detail/actions**. New
  `profile_facts.h` (pure `lib/app_logic`) is the shared derived-fact layer — peak + estimated
  duration (∫dT/rate + holds) for the row/detail facts, and the **requested/achievable curve point
  sampling** — computed off a loaded profile's phases via the §12 curve math (`thermal_math`), no
  `OvenModel` reach-in. New `profile_curve` widget (`lib/ui_logic`) draws those two polylines in a
  themed instrument box (requested = dim dashed, achievable = accent solid, + the "uncalibrated"
  note) — the **minimal first cut of C5's feasibility widget** (per the decision to draw a real curve
  now); C5 extends the *same* widget to amber-divergence flags + closed-loop overshoot, reusing the
  point math. `ProfileLibraryViewModel` (per mode, pure) supplies rows/facts and the store-mutating
  actions: **Dup** (owns the `copy` / `copy 2` … suffix naming + collision resolution the store left
  to the UI) and
  **Delete** (behind a new reusable `confirm_dialog` — a *simple* confirm, **not** the press-and-hold
  arm gesture §19/§22 reserve for energizing hazards, and **not** danger-red for the same reason).
  §23 **stock gating** rendered: Edit → "Save as", Delete disabled. `selectable_list` gained an
  optional **leading footer action** (the `+ New` button; the settings hub passes none) and
  `kMaxItems` 12→32 to hold a full library (a `static_assert` in the screen ties it to
  `ProfileStore::kMaxListed`); its **Open button disables when no row is selectable** (`canOpen()`),
  so an empty library shows Open greyed rather than falsely pressable. **New/Edit/Load** leave for
  screens C4 does not own (editor §12/C5, Setup §19/C6) — published as `NAV_PROFILE_*` intents,
  observed only by tests until those land (the posture Home's tile intents held before Settings
  existed; the *which-profile* + working-copy handoff is a seam C5/C6 own). Wired into `main.cpp`
  (router `SCREEN_PROFILES`, **cached like Home** with a reset-to-chooser hook — the stateless
  two-tile chooser is its default view; the list/detail pages rebuild on demand and re-read the store,
  so caching the resident screen is safe) over the two `ProfileStore`s already instantiated at boot;
  the `·` middot separating the row facts was added to `red_hat_mono_14/16` (the pipeline reproduced
  the committed 14px glyphs byte-for-byte first).
  Host-tested `test_profile_library` (native_ui_cyd, both geometries — driven through the real button
  seams so it is geometry-independent) + `test_profile_facts` (native_logic) **plus
  `fuzz/fuzz_profile_facts.cpp`** (profile_facts is a new consumer of an untrusted loaded `Phase[]`,
  §7 — facts/curve stay finite + bounded, no NaN reaches `lv_line`; 3.7M+ runs clean).
  Two incidental fixes rode along: **`oven_cal::DEFAULT` → `kDefaultModel`** (C4 is the first
  CYD-firmware consumer of `oven_cal.h`, and `DEFAULT` collided with Arduino's `DEFAULT` macro — a
  latent landmine for any firmware TU including both), and **`board_build.filesystem = littlefs`** on
  the CYD envs so `uploadfs` builds a LittleFS image matching the firmware's mount (the PlatformIO
  default is SPIFFS, which would not mount). **Verified end-to-end on the 3.5" board** (flash +
  `uploadfs` demo fixtures `data/profiles/` → boot reports `[profiles] cure=1 reflow=2`; chooser →
  list → detail curve render on glass, stock gating on the seeded stock profile).
  **Deferred**: ~~the **recently-used sort** (no usage clock — `list()` stays alphabetical)~~
  *(landed with **C6 PR1**: the controller stamps a monotonic `oven_Profile.use_seq` and sorts the
  reply per the request's `ProfileSort`, so the CYD renders the order it receives and carries no
  recency key of its own — the missing "usage clock" turned out to be a sequence counter, which is
  the right answer on a board with no RTC)*, and the
  **stock-seed *feature*** — a reviewable seed source (JSON→generator), §24 "Restore stock profiles",
  and the marking semantics (needs a seed-source decision; the `uploadfs` mechanism + demo fixtures
  above are in place, but the feature itself is future work) — a fresh flash otherwise shows the §23
  empty state. **Pick context** (Setup → Load) entry lands with C6; the manage-context CRUD is
  complete. Unblocks **C6**.*
- [x] **C5** [C] — profile editor (2 PRs: overview + phase-editor field list;
  then feasibility-curve preview). deps: C1, B1, B2. (§12)
  **REWIRED 2026-07-17 (Wave R3):** still edits an in-RAM `Phase[]` working copy (preview
  unchanged), but opening fetches via `ProfileGetReq` and Save issues `ProfilePut` over
  the link (a `phase_codec` at the wire boundary), gaining a saving/save-failed state.
  *Shipped as `ProfileEditorScreen` (`lib/ui_logic/profile_editor_screen.*`), the `SettingsScreen`
  hub-and-spoke controller cloned: **Overview** (feasibility curve + one-phase-per-row list + Save)
  → **Phase editor** (a field list per phase) → the shared numeric keypad → **name entry**. Edits
  parameters, never the curve (§12): each phase number routes through `NumericFieldConfig` +
  `create_numeric_keypad` (all wide-range → keypad per the >20-step rule), fans cycle Auto→On→Off
  in place, UV/motor toggle (cure only), and the cure **Hold** field's label/amber note track the
  exposure-vs-raw-seconds semantics. Works on a **working copy** via `beginEdit(profile, store,
  saveAs)`; only Save commits (a stock source or a fresh New routes through name entry, §23 Save-as);
  Save is gated on `compileRecipe().hardValid` (red word blocks) with an amber word for a
  physically-optimistic profile (`hasAmber()`) — the shared validator, never a second one. The
  **Advanced** path (add/delete/reorder phases) is gated on `subj_advanced`. New
  `profile_templates.h` seeds NEW from the fixed per-mode templates (reflow preheat/soak/reflow/cool,
  cure warm/cure/cool) + seeds each phase's name from its role label (`seedPhaseName`; see the
  per-phase-names follow-up below).
  **PR2 feasibility preview** extends `profile_facts` + the C4 `profile_curve` widget (the same one,
  as C4 flagged): `sampleCurve`/`computeFacts` now **fan-Auto-resolve** the achievable curve via
  `fan_resolver` (so preview and compiled advisories agree on fans); new `anyRampRateLimited` drives
  an **amber divergence flag** (the requested line goes amber where the oven can't meet it); new
  `sampleOvershoot` runs the achievable trajectory through the `{a,b,τ}` lag as a faint **closed-loop
  settling** trace (§12's optional-later, bounded to `kMaxCurvePoints` steps). Wired into `main.cpp`
  (`SCREEN_EDITOR`; the `NAV_PROFILE_NEW/EDIT` seams C4 reserved are resolved in the composition root
  off the library's selection; exit returns to the edited mode's list). **The editor is
  heap-allocated on first use, not a static**: the library's two view-models already fill the static
  DRAM segment and the editor is just as large, but the two are never co-visible — a static both
  overflowed `dram0_0_seg` by 3.3 kB. Two build-config facts: the **UI + sim lanes gained nanopb**
  (the editor validates via the shared `recipe_compiler` → generated `oven.pb.h`; C8's fault overlay
  will need it too) via a `lib/ui_logic/library.json` (the `lib/protocol` pattern) + `native_ui_cyd`/
  `sim_common` deps. Host-tested `test_profile_editor` (both geometries, driven through the button
  seams) + `test_profile_templates` + extended `test_profile_facts`; `fuzz_profile_facts` extended to
  the iterative overshoot + divergence math (5.2 M+ runs clean). Verified in the sim on the 3.5"
  (Overview curve with all three traces + amber divergence; Phase editor field list with fan
  resolution). Unblocks **C6** (Setup loads a library profile as a run template into this editor).*
  *Follow-up — per-phase names + name-entry keyboard: the `Phase` domain model gained a stored
  `name` (`kPhaseNameCap=16`, `phase.h`), seeded from the template role and editable from a new
  **Name** row in the phase editor; `phaseLabel()` collapsed to a seed-time helper and every display
  site reads `phase.name`. Persisted in the `ProfileStore` blob — **no version bump** (pre-release);
  the demo `data/profiles/**/*.bin` fixtures were regenerated by a new host generator
  `tools/gen_profiles.cpp`, and each phase name is NUL-terminated on the untrusted load path
  (`copyOut`). The profile name (Save-as) and phase rename share **one** on-screen keyboard
  (`buildNameEntry`, targeted by `naming_phase_`): a compact custom LVGL map tuned for short names
  (letters + `⌫` + `✓`; mode `abc/ABC/1#`; the header **Back** is the only cancel — no on-keyboard
  ✗), height-bounded + bottom-pinned, with per-key **popover previews** (`lv_keyboard_set_popovers`)
  and no auto-repeat. Added `⌫` (0xF55A) to the body fonts `red_hat_mono_14/16` (the default
  keyboard's newline ↵ 0xF8A2 isn't in Font Awesome free — hence the custom map), and bumped
  `LV_MEM_SIZE` 64→80 kB for the popover's compositing layer. **[Corrected 2026-07-17: that
  parenthetical was wrong — `LV_MEM_SIZE` is a STATIC pool (`work_mem_int` in `dram0_0_seg`), not
  runtime heap, and 80 kB overflows a clean build by ~15.7 kB; it only ever linked because
  incremental builds reused a stale pool object (an `lv_conf.h` edit doesn't retrigger the LVGL
  recompile). Reverted to 64 kB. See the DRAM-budget note in design.md "Consequences worth
  knowing".]** Host-tested (`test_profile_store` name round-trip + untrusted NUL-term,
  `test_profile_templates` seeded names, `test_profile_editor` rename + Back-cancel seams at both
  geometries); verified in the sim and on the 3.5" hardware.*
- [x] **C6** [C] — Setup + Confirm. deps: C4, C5. (§19)
  *Shipped as the collapsed run flow: Home → mode → profile **picker** (the C4 library reused in
  pick mode, MRU-sorted) → **Confirm**, the one preview + press-and-hold arm page. There is no
  separate Setup screen — §19's "start empty, then Load" became "pick first", which is the same
  gate with one fewer hop. `ConfirmRunScreen` (`lib/ui_logic`) drives the §9 start handshake
  (Recipe → Ack → Start → Ack → enable heartbeat) with Starting/Failed pages, and gates the arm on
  §19's readiness set: hard-valid recipe, healthy link, the reflow workpiece-probe check
  (`tcAttached`), and — added with C8 PR3 — the **door closed**.*
- [x] **C7** [C] — Run/Monitor (3 PRs: layout/telemetry/STOP; projected-vs-actual chart + live ETA;
  cure paused/resume overlay). deps: C3, B2, B6. (§15) *PRs 1–2 of 3. `RunScreen` + `RunTracker` (`lib/app_logic`): live control
  temp vs setpoint, phase + slipping ETA, output indicators, the §16 deviation cue, the
  projected-vs-actual `run_curve`, the §15 nav lock (no Back) and the immediate single-tap STOP.
  **PR3 (cure paused/resume) landed with B6.** A door-open during a CURE now goes to a Paused page
  instead of aborting: the run so far as a chart (the only evidence for "is this part still worth
  finishing"), an amber door cue, Abort as a plain tap and **HOLD to resume** as press-and-hold —
  §19's rule, since Resume re-energizes UV. Gated on door-closed AND the remainder compiling (see
  B6's third fuzz finding). Both §15 expiries implemented: lost heartbeat and a §10-placeholder
  timeout. Resuming routes through Confirm's existing commit machine, so the §9 handshake and its
  Nak/timeout page are reused rather than re-implemented. Reflow still aborts outright (§15).
  **A real bug it exposed:** the door-abort telemetry frame carries `elapsed_ms = 0` (the controller
  has reset its executor), which the tracker read as "back at t=0" — stamping the current
  temperature onto the chart's first point, feeding a bogus residual into the §16 stats, and
  skewing the phase model enough that the remainder re-ran an already-finished phase. Only RUNNING
  frames reach the tracker now; the DONE/FAULT paths were equally affected.*
- [x] **Bench-found follow-ups** (C6/C7 validation on the two-devkit bench against the A10 sim,
  2026-07-19; a full cure ran ramp→hold→cool→"Run complete" end-to-end):
  - [x] ~~**ASAP ramp starting above target faulted TARGET_UNREACHABLE** (§5/§15).~~ *Bench-found
    2026-07-19 on the cure resume, fixed same day. `ProfileExecutor::reached()` used a SYMMETRIC
    band, so a chamber 9 °C ABOVE target was indistinguishable from one 9 °C below: the executor
    waited to heat to a temperature it had already passed, the PID correctly commanded zero duty,
    and the rate-floor watchdog read the absence of a rise as a stall. Both callers are UPWARD waits
    (RAMP_ASAP is only emitted when heating; the reflow hold-entry gate waits for the workpiece to
    come up), so `reached()` is now one-sided — being hotter than asked is overshoot, which the hold
    manages, not a target you failed to reach. **Root assumption exposed:** §15's "ASAP re-heat"
    presumes the chamber has COOLED below target while the door was open; with a door open for
    seconds and the overshoot below putting it above setpoint already, it had not.*
  - [x] ~~**Ramp overshoot mitigation (control loop, §5).**~~ *Bench-found 2026-07-19, fixed
    2026-07-20. On a fast ASAP ramp into a hold the PID held full duty through the whole ramp and
    overcharged the calrod (elementC≈1000 J/K); when the control temp reached setpoint the stored
    element heat carried the chamber ~15 °C past it (a 60 °C cure peaked **74.9 °C** on the
    two-devkit bench, matching the sim), which tripped the §16 deviation cue, stretched the
    cool-down, and — the reason it was raised in priority — left the chamber above setpoint, the
    state that made the cure resume start above its own target and fault TARGET_UNREACHABLE.
    **Fixed as §5's own advice says to** ("reach for feedforward before D"), by making the
    trajectory known instead of enabling Kd: new `lib/control_logic/setpoint_shaper.h`
    (`SetpointShaper`) paces the PI's reference toward the target at the plant's achievable rate
    from `thermal_math.h`'s envelopes — the same ones the CYD's ETA/preview integrate, so the
    controller now tracks the curve the CYD projects — and `ControllerRunPath` feeds forward along
    it via a new `rampFeedforwardDuty()` (holding duty + rate ÷ `rateGain`, the term B2 shipped
    for exactly this and that had no consumer). Timed ramps are transparent; descents pass
    through (§5: cool-down is open-loop, not a PID descent); the shaped reference is never above
    the executor's, so it can only reduce commanded heat, and `clampSetpoint`/`safety.tick()` are
    untouched. **Sim peak: 74.9 → 60.25 °C**, i.e. 0.25 °C of overshoot.
    **Two findings the work turned up, both bigger than the shaping itself:**
    (1) **Pacing at the envelope rate does nothing on its own** — the envelope *is* the
    saturated-duty rate, so a reference paced at it commands the same full duty as the step it
    replaced. What kills the overshoot is the **approach taper** (rate ≤ remaining/τ, τ anchored to
    the element's own time constant), which eases duty off before arrival.
    (2) **Conditional anti-windup was not enough**, and the diagnosis only showed up once the run
    path was instrumented: at arrival the reference was already *behind* the measurement and duty
    was still **0.72 — essentially all integral**. Conditional integration bounds the integrator
    only by what keeps total duty in range, which on a long ramp is most of the range. So
    `HeaterControl` gained `setIntegrating()` and the integrator is now **gated to holds**
    (feedforward owns ramps, feedback owns standing offsets), with authority left *unbounded* while
    gated on — a magnitude cap was tried first and rejected because it costs the loop its ability to
    hold setpoint on feedback alone when the cal is wrong, which uncalibrated it is. That single
    change took the peak from 67.4 → 60.25 °C.
    **And one interaction worth remembering:** the taper slows the approach, and the executor's
    per-segment watchdog judges a target-gated wait by the **measured** rate — so a taper left to
    decay freely gets a normally-arriving run faulted TARGET_UNREACHABLE by its own watchdog (found
    in `test_run_path`, not on the bench). The taper now carries a floor kept clear of
    `rateFloorCPerS`, `run_path.h` `static_assert`s the relationship, and the guard costs 1.5 °C of
    the win (peak 61.7 °C).
    **New `test_run_path` suite** — the run path had only ever been tested *through*
    `test_sim_run`'s closed loop, which can hide a wrong feedforward behind the integrator
    compensating for it; it now pins the composition arithmetically, and picked up the door-abort /
    arm-disarm / fault-routing behaviours nothing directly tested. Plus `test_setpoint_shaper`, the
    §5 overshoot regression in `test_sim_run`, the `HeaterControl` gate test, and
    `fuzz/fuzz_setpoint_shaper.cpp` (107M runs clean) — which found **`steadyStateDuty()` emitting
    NaN for a non-finite model** (`clampf` passes NaN through, every comparison against it being
    false); now total, which also removes a latent NaN source from the §12 preview curves.
    All new constants (`approachTauS`, `maxLeadC`, `arriveBandC`, `minApproachRateCPerS`) are
    §10-open placeholders — D7 tunes them with the PID gains.
    **Bench-verified 2026-07-20 on the two-devkit rig** (`esp32dev_control_sim` + the 3.5"
    `esp32dev_cyd35_bench`), A/B against a build of the parent commit so the only variable is this
    change — ASAP → 60 °C hold (the reported case): **74.8 → 61.6 °C**; timed 80 °C/120 s → hold
    (the stock bench stimulus): 90.6 → 85.6 °C. *(Those runs were driven by the CYD bench
    stimulus, which this same day's bench-safety fix deleted — see A8. Re-runs start from Confirm.)*
    The ASAP baseline reproduced the originally reported 74.9 °C to within 0.1 °C, and the fixed
    firmware landed within 0.1 °C of the sim's prediction (61.7 °C) — the A10 twin is doing its job.
    Neither run faulted. **Two honest caveats the bench made visible**, both of which the sim's
    single headline number hid: (1) reaching the hold took **90 s → 135 s** on the ASAP profile, the
    price of the soft landing (`approachTauS` is the dial, D7's to tune) — though the baseline's
    stored heat then kept the chamber ABOVE its 60 °C target for minutes afterward, so time-to-usable
    is not obviously worse; and (2) on a **timed** ramp the shaper is transparent by design, so the
    taper barely engages and the improvement comes only from the trajectory feedforward + the
    integration gate — 5.6 °C of overshoot remains there. A timed ramp authored at the plant's limit
    is *asking* for saturated duty to the last second; B1's amber rate-limited flag and §16's
    deviation cue are what report that, not this.
  - [x] ~~**Door-open dismisses "Run complete" — but NOT a fault (§15/§16/§22).**~~ *Done with
    **C8 PR3**, which grew into §15's whole DECIDED door behaviour once it turned out `door_open`
    had no producer at all. See C8 below.*
- [x] **C8** [C] — Run Summary (§16) + Fault overlay (§22) + Settings hub + panels
  (§24). deps: B7, B5, C1, C2, C3. *Settings shipped with B5; three PRs closed the rest.*
  *PR1 (§16): the Run screen's Ended page becomes the real summary — outcome badge (+ fault cause),
  the completed projected-vs-actual overlay, fit verdict + max/RMS + per-phase target hits, the
  drift advisory as an **inline amber banner** (never the modal), Run again / Home. `RunTracker::
  finish()` had returned a full `RunFitResult` since B7 with nothing rendering it. Kept as the Ended
  *page*, not a new router screen: the fit is only computed there and the curve is that screen's, so
  a separate screen would exist only to be handed both — and it gives §22's `AckRoute::RunSummary` a
  target already on screen. Curve samples are now retained in `RunScreen` (the summary redraws after
  `buildEnded()` frees the live chart); a mid-run rebuild gains its history for free.*
  *PR2 (§22): `fault_overlay` on **`lv_layer_top`**, not the router — the router owns one screen and
  deletes create-on-demand ones, so a modal parented to a screen would die with it. The layer takes
  `LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE` while up (LVGL's top layer passes touches through otherwise; a modal you
  can tap past is not a modal). Renders `formatTitle`/`guidanceText`/`codeNameText` + the `+N`
  supersede + the live reading, with a single-tap Acknowledge routing to summary-or-Home. **No
  FaultViewModel**: §22 asks for `lv_subject_t` indirection "so no `lv_` calls happen off the UI
  task", but the CYD services its link from `loop()` — the same task as `lv_timer_handler` — so the
  subject would be a publish read synchronously by its only subscriber. Fed from `telemetry.
  fault_code` (edge-triggered) because `CydLink` forwards content to ONE app observer and
  `ManagementClient` holds it; A4b built that field as exactly this backup channel.*
  *PR3 (§15 door): see the follow-up above. `IDoorSensor` + `Esp32DoorSensor` on the donor's **DS3**
  dry contact (never DS1/DS2 — mains-referenced and sacrificial respectively), fail-safe-to-open
  polarity, the plant modelling **DS1** (open door removes element power whatever duty is
  commanded), `telemetry.door_open` + §9's send-on-change, the controller safing + ending the run to
  IDLE **without faulting** (§22 excludes it), and CYD-side: `RunOutcome::DoorOpened`, the
  summary's door dismiss (never on a Fault outcome), §19's Start gate in both modes, §17's door wake.*
  ***The type fix PR2 forced:*** *`fault_table` + `FaultController` now take the **raw wire
  `int32_t`** (`fault_table::FaultCodeWire`), not `oven_FaultCode`. nanopb stores a decoded varint
  into the enum field verbatim, so an out-of-enum code is reachable and merely *holding* it as the
  enum type is UB — `protocol::wireEnum` exists for this and was itself added after a fuzzer found
  it on `recipe.mode`; nobody had applied it to fault codes. Sanitizing with `wireEnumOr` was the
  alternative and is wrong here: §22 wants the real number shown, and schema skew is what produces
  these codes. Also added total `guidanceText`/`codeNameText` beside `formatTitle` — `faultInfo()`
  returns nullptr strings for an unknown code, and per-consumer fallbacks are how one eventually
  forgets and passes nullptr to `lv_label_set_text` on the one screen that must never fail.*
  *New `fuzz_fault_controller` (table totality over out-of-enum codes; `formatTitle` stays
  NUL-terminated and valid UTF-8 for every code × buffer size; latch never-auto-dismiss /
  never-downgrade / sticky-overTemp); `fuzz_run_tracker` extended to the whole `RunFitResult`;
  door churn added to `fuzz_sim_run` and `fuzz_oven_plant`.*
  ***Still open:*** *the buzzer pattern/volume + RGB-LED (TBD §10); §22's optional **Details** pane
  (it wants the raw last-telemetry vector — belongs with B8·1's log record); and a human review pass
  on B7's draft advisory strings, which are now also known to be **glyph-constrained** — the fonts
  carry ASCII + `°` + `·` + Font Awesome only, so no em-dash and no literal `⚠` (U+26A0 is not
  `LV_SYMBOL_WARNING`'s 0xF071). Both had shipped as missing-glyph boxes, including on the §22
  modal; fixed in PR1.*
- [x] **C10** [C] — second CYD board variant (3.5" ST7796S 320×480 portrait) + the board
  abstraction that makes a third cheap. deps: none (HMI-side only). *Motivated by §21, not by
  the extra pixels: the 3.5" board **survives WiFi bring-up** (1 boot, 0 brownouts, radio up,
  link `matched=1`) where the 2.8"'s AMS1117 collapses — and without a radio there is no OTA,
  the controller's only field reflash path (§25). It is now `default_envs`; the 2.8" stays
  supported and both are built by `make build` + CI so neither rots.*
  *The rule that made it cheap: **nothing under `lib/` learns a board identity.** `CYD_BOARD_*`
  is read only by the new `include/cyd_board.h` (pins, orientation, buffers, capabilities);
  `lib/` sees neutral geometry (`lib/panel/panel.h` → `panel::kPortrait`; `theme.h` re-authored
  in **millimetres**, `static_assert`ing that the 2.8"'s numbers are byte-identical) and
  capabilities as **data** (`subj_has_ambient_light`, `device_info.h`). Fonts are the one thing
  mm cannot scale, so 16/32 px are picked by **pitch** — generation verified reproducible
  (re-running the recipe reproduces the committed 14 px font byte-for-byte). Ports finally
  earned their keep: `LgfxDisplay`/`LgfxTouch`/`InjectedTouch` (§11's claim was aspirational
  until now). Full inventory + consequences in §6a.*
  *Five latent bugs it flushed out, all pre-existing: an unsigned-underflow that expired the
  §17 sleep timeout instantly (latent on the 2.8", fatal on the slower-flushing 3.5");
  `pio test -e embedded` hadn't compiled in months (now in `make build` + CI); `dev-shot`
  silently wrote black PNGs on an unreadable panel (now 501); LVGL's default theme was tinting
  our dark UI's DISABLED state **lighter** via `recolor` (the honest cause of "washed out");
  and ✕ Cancel slid 38 px out from under the finger as you typed (`flex_grow` on a hidden
  child). Also: a `pinMode`-after-`digitalWrite` on the controller's contactor (§4 fail-safe
  adjacent) — see the fix in `Esp32Contactor`.*
  *Open: the 3.5" panel's contrast is poor (blacks read grey at every backlight level), which
  is a real input to §23's ISA-101 palette — flagged as an open in §6a/§10. And
  `PANEL_PX_PER_MM_X100=649` is nominal; measure the active area with calipers (654 would move
  `STEPPER_BTN` 111→112).*
- [x] **B6** [B] — remainder-profile generator for cure resume. deps: B1. (§15)
  *New `lib/app_logic/remainder.h` (namespace `cure_resume` — `remainder()` is a C99 math function in
  the global namespace, so `remainder::build` does not parse). Given the interrupted profile and how
  far it got, emits §15's "RAMP_ASAP re-heat to the current target + the remaining hold/phases +
  remaining UV dose". Scales BOTH the dose and the raw `holdSeconds`, because the cure hold falls
  back to seconds when the turntable is off or the model is uncalibrated — which is the path this
  project is on today. Refuses reflow outright (§15: no resume) and refuses an all-but-finished last
  phase. `RunTracker::holdProgress01()` supplies the delivered fraction, read off the COMPILED
  timeline (a phase lowers to ramp+hold) rather than wall-clock, so an ASAP ramp that ran long
  cannot be mistaken for soak.*
  ***Three fuzz findings, two of them harness bugs worth recording:*** *(1) `memcmp` on a `Phase` is
  unsound — 35 bytes of members in a 36-byte struct, and copy-assignment never writes the pad, so
  the check was reading uninitialised stack. (2) The harness compiled against a looser cap than the
  controller enforces (`CURE_HARD_MAX_C` is the LOWER ceiling, §4) and immediately produced a
  hard-valid compile the real validator NAKed. (3) The real one: **"original compiles ⇒ remainder
  compiles" is FALSE** — a profile at the 32-segment wire ceiling can tip over when the head is
  rewritten, because forcing `rampSeconds` to 0 switches that phase from a timed ramp to
  `RAMP_ASAP` and B1 lowers the two differently. Unreachable at realistic phase counts, but the
  reason **Resume is gated on the remainder compiling** rather than assumed. 19.7M runs clean.*
- [x] **B9** [B] — characterization-run generator within safety bounds. deps: B1, B2. (§5, §20)
  **DONE 2026-07-21 — reframed from "random-profile" to a PLANNED calibration sweep.** Scoping this
  surfaced that §5/§20's DECIDED *random*-profile approach is the wrong tool for this plant:
  thermal-plant system-ID practice (FOPDT step/decay tests → gain-schedule) wants **planned tests at
  several operating points**, and a random *setpoint* profile run closed-loop lets the PID cancel the
  excitation (§5 itself already conceded the open-loop-duty alternative gives "cleaner
  identifiability"). Confirmed the direction with the user, then revised design.md §5/§7/§20/§10 and
  built the planned generator instead. **The pivot cost no scope or risk** — the data is observable
  through a *planned, closed-loop* sweep with no new actuator/segment type: an ASAP ramp saturates the
  PID (→ `heatRate(T,fan)` over its bulk), each hold settles to `duty_ss(T,fan)`, every run's implicit
  passive cool-down (recipe_compiler) logs `coolRate(T)`, and the wall-vs-workpiece lag gives
  `{a,b,τ}(fan)`.
  *New `lib/app_logic/calibration_sweep.h` (namespace `cal_sweep`, header-only, pure, **deterministic
  — no RNG**, modeled on B6's `remainder.h`): `gridFor(Scope)` expands Quick/Standard/Thorough into a
  `Grid` (setpoint bands + hold + cool-repeats, all §10-open placeholders); `runCount()` +
  `generateRun(grid, i, caps, out)` emit run `i` as a plain-heat **REFLOW** `ProfileDraft` — a
  fan-off then a fan-on staircase (ASAP-ramp+hold per band) followed by dedicated cool-only decays.
  **Airtight-by-construction safety, identical posture to the compiler/remainder differential:** takes
  `Caps` from the call site (never reaches into `oven_safety.h`), clamps every target into
  `[caps.minC, caps.capC]` (dropping bands the cap forbids, refusing degenerate caps), emits no
  `uv`/`motor` so content-derived mode is REFLOW (the higher cap), floors every hold `>0`, and stays
  ≪ the 32-segment budget — so every emitted run compiles `hardValid` and the real `RecipeValidator`
  accepts it.
  Host-tested `test_calibration_sweep` (7 cases: every run of every scope uploadable; tight-cap drops
  high bands; degenerate caps refused; runCount boundary; both fan states + ascending staircase;
  cool-only runs; determinism) **plus `fuzz/fuzz_calibration_sweep.cpp`** — the fuzz_compiler/
  fuzz_remainder differential over any scope × untrusted user cap (clamped to the reflow hard-max as
  the real call site does): every generated run is `hardValid`, validator-accepted, and never exceeds
  the content hard-max. 9.2M+ runs clean. **No runtime consumer yet** — the §20 wizard doesn't exist
  (`NAV_CALIBRATE` is a dead-end, `src_cyd/main.cpp`), so B9 ships as a standalone logic utility, the
  host-tested/wiring-deferred posture A5/A6/A4b took. **§10-open:** the grid numbers (bands, hold
  time, cool repeats per scope) and whether to add the parked open-loop-duty **PRBS** refinement once
  a first fit exists (§5). *(Adjacent design discussions the same session, not built here: the ESP32
  MCU-internal die sensor is only a fail-safe-conservative secondary to §6's dedicated I²C bay sensor;
  and PCB thermal mass need not enter reflow control — the measured-workpiece-TC loop is already
  mass-invariant — so no per-run mass entry, favor adaptive ETA if projection accuracy is wanted.)*

## Wave 4 — Mains hardware + complete safety chain (§8 step 2; gated by D1)

- [ ] **D2** [D] — interlock/mains one-line diagram. deps: D1. *Required
  deliverable before any mains work.* (§6)
- [ ] **D3** [D] — safety-chain fitout: donor interlock chain, cutoffs, fuse,
  contactor, high-limit, SSR, UV door switch, window film — then re-run A8's
  step-1 fail-safe proof against the real chain. deps: D1, D2, A8. (§4, §8 step 2)
  *The re-run must cover **both** step-1 clauses — pulled TX **and CYD reboot** — and the reboot
  one must be observed with nothing re-arming heat afterwards (the CYD bench stimulus that
  defeated it was deleted 2026-07-20). Start the run from Confirm (§19), so the proof exercises
  the production path; an LED proved firmware, this proves a contactor coil's release time and an
  SSR that holds to the next zero crossing. Also the first real-hardware test of link-on-UART0,
  which §25's OTA depends on (§2).*
- [ ] **D4** [D] — TC front-end IC selection + wall-TC channel bring-up, then
  workpiece-TC install (pass-through, panel jack, reflow rack) as separate items.
  *Provides the real temp-input adapter.* deps: D1, D3. (§6)

## Wave 5 — First vertical slice: UV cure end-to-end (§8 step 3)

- [ ] **D5** [D] — UV cure end-to-end. The first full vertical slice; mostly
  integration once the software exists. deps: A4–A7, B1–B4, C3–C7, D3, D4.
  (§8 step 3)
- [ ] **B8·2** [B] — SD logging PR2: RAM ring buffer + dedicated link task
  isolating heartbeat TX from card stalls. deps: B8·1, hardware (to measure real
  stalls). (§7)
- [ ] **D6·tools** [D] — PC-side tools: log decoder (protobuf → DuckDB/CSV/Parquet) +
  fit → `oven_cal.h` emitter. deps: B8·1 log format. *Hardware-independent — can
  start as soon as the format lands.* (§6, §7)

## Wave 6 — Reflow, PCB, connectivity (§8 steps 4–6)

- [ ] **D6·wizard** [D] — calibration-wizard screens. deps: D4, D5. (§20)
- [ ] **D7** [D] — reflow bring-up: PID tuning, calibration runs, drift
  thresholds. deps: D5, D4, D6. (§8 step 4)
- [ ] **D8** [D] — custom PCB (same ESP32 target); move firmware over unchanged,
  re-verify safety on real hardware. deps: D7. (§8 step 5)
- [ ] **D9** [D] — WiFi/OTA **on the controller** (several PRs; REVISED 2026-07-17 per
  the §2 CYD-is-a-remote change, see Wave R below): WiFi + HTTP data server **on the
  controller's radio**; controller **self-OTA over WiFi** (standard A/B — the old
  CYD-as-ISP / ESP32 ROM-loader client / GPIO0-EN leg is **dropped**); `OtaController`
  state machine (host-testable with fakes); OTA wizard screens (CYD renders, controller
  acts); controller partition-fit (app twice + LittleFS in 4 MB) measurement.
  **New opens (§10):** the **CYD's own** field-reflash path once WiFi leaves it (USB vs
  controller-as-ISP), and the **data-server↔CYD-SD bridge** (logs are on the CYD's SD).
  deps: D6·tools pipeline, hardware, Wave R. (§21, §25, §27; §8 step 6)

## Wave R — CYD-is-a-UI-remote re-architecture (2026-07-17; storage + protocol)

The §2 revision: the CYD ran out of static DRAM to host the profile/settings stores +
WiFi alongside LVGL (§6a), so those responsibilities move to the controller and the CYD
becomes a remote client. This wave lands the **storage + protocol** move (the memory win
→ bigger render buffers); WiFi/OTA/data-server stay design-only (D9). Details →
design.md §2/§7/§9/§11/§21/§25/§27. Ordered; each ~one PR.

- [x] **R1** [A] — **protocol expansion.** Add typed `Phase`/`Profile`/`ProfileSummary`/
  `Settings` + management messages (`ProfileList/Get/Put/Delete/Dup/Rename`,
  `SettingsGet/Put`) to `proto/oven.proto` + `oven.options`; new `kTfType*` ids
  (`0x19+`) + router cases + `IMessageObserver` virtuals; the new **request/reply**
  reliability pair (`RequestClient`/`RequestResponder`, request→data-reply) in
  `lib/protocol`. Host round-trip tests (`native_control`). *Schema hash changes —
  expected (matched-pair reflash).* deps: none. (§9)
- [x] **R2** [A/B] — **controller owns the stores.** Relocate `IProfileStorage`/
  `ISettingsStorage`; move `ProfileStore`/`SettingsStore` → `lib/control_logic` (store
  `oven_Profile`); `LittleFsProfileStorage`/settings adapter in `src_control`; controller
  partition + `board_build.filesystem=littlefs` + `uploadfs` stock seeds via updated
  `tools/gen_profiles.cpp`; `ProfileResponder`/`SettingsResponder` into `ControllerLink`.
  Move `fuzz_profile_store` to the control context; add `fuzz_profile_wire` (controller
  parsing untrusted management frames — it is the safety MCU). deps: R1. (§7/§11/§23)
  ***Fuzz correction 2026-07-21 (the deferred-follow-ups sweep):*** *the `fuzz_profile_store` move
  above did **not** happen — it kept fuzzing the CYD's `lib/app_logic/profile_store.h`, which R3
  then deleted, so for four days the harness covered a store no board runs while
  `control::ProfileStore` had no dedicated coverage. Retargeted now. The wire half of R2's intent
  was already met without a `fuzz_profile_wire` env: `fuzz_frontdoor`/`fuzz_decode` drive raw bytes
  through `fuzz_pipeline.h`'s `ManagementResponder` → store, so a `ProfilePut` is covered end-to-end.
  What genuinely had nothing was the **raw flash-blob** path — reachable via §7's no-reflash push,
  and via `LittleFS.begin(formatOnFail)` leaving a half-written blob after a reset. The differential
  also got stronger in the move: a loaded profile now decodes through the real `phase_codec` before
  `compileRecipe`, which is the actual CYD path since R3, so the property spans the wire types.*
- [x] **R3** [B/C] — **CYD remote client.** `phase_codec` (`Phase↔oven_Phase`);
  `ProfileClient`/`SettingsClient` (`lib/app_logic`) over the request/reply path; rewire
  `ProfileLibraryViewModel`, `ProfileEditorScreen`, `SettingsScreen` to async with
  **loading / error / saving** states. Drop the CYD's LittleFS/NVS/`ProfileStore`/
  `SettingsStore` + mount + `data/` + `filesystem=littlefs`. `native_logic_cyd` +
  `native_ui_cyd`(+`_35`) tests against a fake client. deps: R1, R2. (§12/§23/§24)
- [x] **R4** [C] — **reclaim the memory (the payoff).** With the stores + WiFi gone from
  production, raise `DRAW_BUF_LINES` (`include/cyd_board.h`, toward 48–60 per §6a's
  measured menu) and optionally restore the 80 kB LVGL pool — each **clean-build verified**
  (`pio run -t clean`). Re-measure with `make perf` + the on-glass perf probe. deps: R3.
  (§6a)

## Deferred follow-ups sweep (2026-07-21)

Not a wave — a pass over the "deferred, land with its consumer" notes that had accumulated
across A7, B7, C4, C8 and Wave R, once every item through Wave 3 + Wave R was done and the
only remaining `[ ]` work was **D1**'s teardown, the hardware chain behind it, and **B8·1**.
Two of the notes turned out to be masking real gaps rather than housekeeping.

- [x] **S1** [A] — **A7's validator was never wired, and its two Start guards.** The find:
  `RecipeValidator` was host-tested from the day it shipped and never passed to
  `ControllerLink`, so the controller ran the accept-all default and §4 layer 1 was not
  executing on hardware. Wired, plus `NAK_ILLEGAL_TRANSITION` + `NAK_WORKPIECE_TC_INVALID`
  and a shared `lib/calibration/workpiece_tc.h`. Full note under **A7** above.
- [x] **S2** [A] — **`fuzz_profile_store` retargeted** at `control::ProfileStore`, covering
  the raw flash-blob path nothing tested, and the Wave R3 dead code deleted with it
  (`lib/app_logic/profile_store.h`, the two orphaned `src_cyd/` adapters, the suite that
  tested the dead store, `filesystem=littlefs` on both CYD envs). Full note under **R2**.
- [x] **S3** [C] — **§16's split drift-advisory strings, reviewed and rewritten.** B7 shipped them
  as drafts explicitly wanting a human pass. Four rules drove the rewrite, recorded above
  `advisoryText()` so a future edit keeps them: **conclusion first** (both drafts opened on
  `boardEst` vs `workTemp`, the discriminator's internals, answering a question the operator did
  not ask); **name the action** (§16 pairs the advisory with a Calibration shortcut, and the Oven
  draft only diagnosed); **say "PCB"** for the workpiece, since "board" means the ESP32s everywhere
  else here and the draft used it twice for the load; and **keep the hedges** — §16 is titled
  *honest by design* and these thresholds are still §10 placeholders.
  *No test change: `test_run_fit` asserts non-empty + differ-per-cause, never the wording.*
  **Rendered in the simulator at both geometries**, which is what set the final length: the C8
  banner is `max_height`-capped and scrolls, and portrait "fits the whole paragraph unscrolled" —
  a first draft ~30 % longer pushed the newly-added *action* sentence below the fold, which would
  have defeated the point of adding it. Tightened until it fits; the 2.8" still scrolls by design
  and keeps its action row.
- [x] **S4** — **backlog hygiene**: the completed bench-found follow-ups marked done, and the
  deferred notes later work had quietly resolved retired in place (C4's recently-used sort →
  C6 PR1's controller-owned `use_seq`; B7's link-timeout ownership → A9's two deliberately
  different windows).
- [x] **S5** [A/C] — **stock-profile seed + §24 "Restore stock profiles"** (§7/§23/§24).
  §23 promises the factory references "can't be lost" and only half-delivers: delete is
  refused, but the sole source is a separate `uploadfs` command, and the controller mounts
  `LittleFS.begin(formatOnFail=true)` — so a corrupt filesystem silently reformats the whole
  library away with no field recovery, and a plain `-t upload` leaves the §23 empty state.
  Two halves: **(a)** extend `tools/gen_profiles.cpp` to also emit a committed
  `stock_profiles.h` of encoded blobs compiled into the controller (234 bytes today, `const`
  → flash `.rodata`, not the tight DRAM), seeded if-missing at boot — idempotent, and it
  makes `uploadfs` optional; **(b)** a `ProfileRestoreStock` request (new frame id, so the
  schema hash moves → matched-pair reflash + corpus reseed) driving the greyed-out
  `HUB_PROFILES` Settings row, per mode, behind the simple `confirm_dialog` (restoring
  energizes nothing, so **not** §19's press-and-hold). `ProfileStore` needs a privileged
  `seedStock()` since `save()`/`remove()` correctly refuse stock — reachable only from the
  firmware's own compiled table, never from the wire: the CYD may *ask* for a restore but can
  never *supply* what gets written. A user profile holding a stock name is skipped, not
  clobbered.
  **DONE 2026-07-21, both halves, shipped as shaped.** `tools/gen_profiles.cpp` grew a second
  output from one authored table — the committed `lib/control_logic/stock_profiles.h` (73 bytes of
  nanopb-encoded `Profile` bodies, `const` → flash `.rodata`) — plus `control::seedStockProfiles()`
  and `ProfileStore::seedStock()`. Boot fills gaps (`overwrite=false`); §24's Restore repairs
  (`overwrite=true`) via the new `ProfileRestoreStock` frame (`0x26`) → `ManagementResponder` →
  a `Profiles` panel on the greyed-out `HUB_PROFILES` row, two per-mode rows behind the shared
  simple `confirm_dialog`. **The generated header joins the fonts in the pre-commit exclude list**
  — clang-format rewraps its byte rows, which would dirty the tree on every regeneration.
  ***Two bugs it turned up, neither in scope:*** *(1) **the generator could never re-run over an
  existing stock fixture.** Its comment claimed it removed the stale blob first "so a re-run cannot
  be refused as a stock-overwrite", but `remove()` refuses stock too (§23) — so it returned false
  and `save()` then refused the overwrite. It only ever worked on a fixture that did not yet exist.
  `seedStock(overwrite)` turned out to be exactly the missing operation. (2) **Consequently the
  committed fixtures were stale**: each grew exactly 2 bytes on regeneration, which is the
  `use_seq` field **C6 PR1** added and which nobody could successfully re-run the generator to pick
  up. Regeneration is now verified byte-identical across runs.*
  Tests: 6 store/seed cases + 2 wire round-trips (`test_profile_management`) and 4 UI cases at both
  geometries (`test_settings_screen`, driven through the real `ManagementResponder` over a
  `LoopbackPipe` so the restore is exercised end-to-end). Schema hash moved as expected — the two
  `Hello` fuzz seeds were regenerated (`make fuzz-seed`).
  **Not done — needs the bench:** flashing a controller *without* `uploadfs` and confirming the
  boot log reports a seeded library rather than `cure=0 reflow=0`, then driving Settings → Profiles
  → Restore on glass. Both boards need a matched-pair reflash for the schema change regardless.
