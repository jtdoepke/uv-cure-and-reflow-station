# Backlog — work breakdown for docs/design.md

Each item is ~one PR (some split into 2–3, noted inline). Section refs (§) point
into `docs/design.md`. Items are ordered into **dependency waves**: everything in
a wave is unblocked once the prior waves land, and items *within* a wave are
mostly independent (parallelizable) — the few intra-wave dependencies are called
out with `deps:`. Each item keeps its original track tag: `[A]` protocol/controller,
`[B]` CYD logic, `[C]` UI, `[D]` hardware. `deps:` lists blocking prerequisites
(satisfied done-work omitted); "soft:" is a preferred-but-not-blocking ordering.

The spine to the MVP — **UV cure end-to-end (D5)** — is the critical path. The two
long poles are the **hardware chain D1→D2→D3→D4** and the **safety proof
A4→A8→D3** (§8 is the intended build sequence). Resolve the §10 open question
tagged to a step before starting that step's items.

## Wave 0 — Done (plumbing + first controller/logic layers)

- [x] **M0.1** [A] — Controller env + skeleton + test lane. (§3, §10, §11)
- [x] **M0.2** [A] — nanopb + TinyFrame deps + protobuf codegen step, both envs. (§9, §10)
- [x] **M0.3** [A] — `.proto` v1 + schema-hash build step (`Hello` frozen; `Recipe`/
  `Segment`, `Start`, `Heartbeat`, `Abort`, `Telemetry`, `Ack`/`Nak`, `Done`,
  `Fault` + `faultCode`). (§9, §22)
- [x] **A1** [A] — TinyFrame framing + `ISerialTransport` port + in-memory pipe. (§9)
- [x] **A2** [A] — Reliability layer: heartbeat, seq/ACK-NAK retry, session,
  schema-hash handshake gate. (§9)
- [x] **A3** [A] — `HeaterActuator` time-proportioning class. (§11)

## New ports to create (not standalone items — build each with its first consumer)

Several waves depend on ports that don't exist yet. Each is one pure interface in
`lib/control_port/` (or a CYD storage port) + a `test/helpers` fake, matching the
existing `IClock`/`IHeaterSwitch` idiom:

- **Temp-input** (control-sensor readback; §11 `IThermocouples`) — first needed by **A5/A6**, also **A4b**.
- **`IContactor`** (energize-to-close; §4) — **A4a**.
- **`IWatchdog`** (kick + reset-cause readback; §9/§11) — **A4b**, **A8**.
- **Output ports** `IUvOutput` / `IFanOutput` / `IMotorOutput` (§11) — **A6** actuation wiring / **A8** / **D5**.
- **Storage port** (LittleFS adapter + in-memory fake; §7) — **B4**, shared by **B5**.
- **SD/log sink port** (§7) — **B8**.

## Wave 1 — Ready now (deps satisfied by Wave 0)

- [ ] **B2** [B] — shared rate-limit/lag math + stub `oven_cal.h` with default
  constants. deps: none. *Foundational — unblocks B1/B3/B9, A5's feedforward, and
  the ETA/preview (C7). One library, several consumers.* (§6, §12, §15)
- [ ] **B7** [B] — fault table + latching/ack-routing logic (§22) and run-summary
  residual math (§16). deps: none. *One small PR each.*
- [ ] **C1** [C] — `NumericEntry` logic + keypad widget. deps: none. *Everything
  numeric routes through it.* (§26)
- [x] **C2** [C] — value-stepper widget. deps: none. (§24) *Shared `NumericFieldConfig`
  (`lib/app_logic`, the >20-step editor-routing rule) + the one-value-per-screen stepper
  editor (`lib/ui_logic`) with min/max disable, hold-to-accelerate, amber caution, and
  keypad/commit/cancel seams for C1/C8. Added a per-widget `jetbrains_mono_28` for the big
  readout; nested `test_ui_cyd`/`test_logic_cyd` into per-suite dirs like `test_control/*`.*
- [x] **C3** [C] — Home/Status hub. deps: none. *Sets the visual language; do
  early.* (§14) Also laid the reusable MVVM UI foundation — theme tokens, shared
  `lv_subject_t` subjects, view-model/view split — and the JetBrains Mono default font.
- [ ] **C9** [C] — sleep/wake (§17) + auto-brightness (§18). deps: none. *Both
  small and self-contained; auto-brightness is the best standalone starter.*
- [ ] **A7** [A] — controller-side recipe validation: range checks,
  mode-from-content derivation, NAK reasons (plugs into A2's `ISetupValidator`
  seam). deps: A2. (§4, §9)
- [ ] **D1** [D] — §10 teardown verifications (one investigation task): fan motor
  type, cooling-fan existence, SMPS reuse, humidity-sensor interface, relay board.
  deps: hardware access. *Gates the `Recipe` schema details, the drivers, and all
  of Track D.* (§6, §10)

## Wave 2 — Controller run path + CYD data/store (build on Wave 1 + new ports)

- [ ] **A4a** [A] — `SafetySupervisor`: command-timeout + fail-safe defaults +
  contactor policy. deps: A2, A3; new `IContactor`. (§4, §9)
- [ ] **A4b** [A] — `SafetySupervisor` L3: setpoint clamp, per-mode over-temp trip,
  stuck-heater plausibility, bounded total runtime, reset-cause → `Fault{WATCHDOG}`.
  deps: A4a, temp-input port, `IWatchdog`; soft: B2 (runtime bound uses `oven_cal`). (§4)
- [ ] **A5** [A] — PID + anti-windup + feedforward hook, tested against a toy
  first-order plant. deps: A3, temp-input port; soft: B2 (feedforward constants). (§5)
- [ ] **A6** [A] — profile executor: segment sequencing, `RAMP_ASAP` target
  gating, hold-entry gate, per-segment watchdog. deps: temp-input port. *Emits the
  setpoint A5's PID tracks — buildable/testable independently of A5.* (§5)
- [ ] **B1** [B] — phase→segment compiler: {target, ramp `x`, hold `y`} → generic
  segments; two-tier validation; exposure→hold-seconds math with fallback/labeling.
  deps: B2. (§5, §12)
- [ ] **B3** [B] — fan-`Auto` resolver at recipe-compile time + pre-calibration
  heuristic fallback. deps: B2. (§5)
- [ ] **B4** [B] — `ProfileStore` over a storage port; per-mode dirs;
  stock-vs-user semantics. deps: storage port. (§7, §23)
- [ ] **B5** [B] — `SettingsStore` + per-field `{min, max, step, units}` config +
  boot-time clamp-to-hard-max. deps: storage port (share B4's). (§4, §24)

  record. deps: SD port. (§7)

## Wave 3 — Bench safety proof, screens, generators (compose Wave 2)

- [ ] **A8** [A] — bench `Esp32*` adapters + dummy-load firmware: heartbeat-pull
  test with an LED "heater" shuts off within the timeout. **Closes §8 step 1.**
  deps: A4a, two dev boards (no oven). *A5/A6/A7 enrich a real bench run but aren't
  needed for the fail-safe proof itself.*
- [ ] **C4** [C] — profile library (list + detail). deps: B4, C3. (§23)
- [ ] **C5** [C] — profile editor (2 PRs: overview + phase-editor field list;
  then feasibility-curve preview). deps: C1, B1, B2. (§12)
- [ ] **C7** [C] — Run/Monitor (3 PRs: layout/telemetry/STOP; projected-vs-actual
  chart + live ETA; cure paused/resume overlay). deps: C3, B2; soft: B6 (resume
  overlay, 3rd PR). (§15)
- [ ] **C8** [C] — Run Summary (§16) + Fault overlay (§22) + Settings hub + panels
  (§24), one each. deps: B7, B5, C1, C2, C3.

- [ ] **B9** [B] — random-profile generator within safety bounds. deps: B1, B2. (§5, §20)
- [ ] **C6** [C] — Setup + Confirm. deps: C4, C5 (loads a library profile as a
  template into the editor). *Do after C4/C5.* (§19)

## Wave 4 — Mains hardware + complete safety chain (§8 step 2; gated by D1)

- [ ] **D2** [D] — interlock/mains one-line diagram. deps: D1. *Required
  deliverable before any mains work.* (§6)
- [ ] **D3** [D] — safety-chain fitout: donor interlock chain, cutoffs, fuse,
  contactor, high-limit, SSR, UV door switch, window film — then re-run A8's
  step-1 fail-safe proof against the real chain. deps: D1, D2, A8. (§4, §8 step 2)
- [ ] **D4** [D] — TC front-end IC selection + wall-TC channel bring-up, then
  workpiece-TC install (pass-through, panel jack, reflow rack) as separate items.
  *Provides the real temp-input adapter.* deps: D1, D3. (§6)

## Wave 5 — First vertical slice: UV cure end-to-end (§8 step 3)

- [ ] **D5** [D] — UV cure end-to-end. The first full vertical slice; mostly
  integration once the software exists. deps: A4–A7, B1–B4, C3–C7, D3, D4.
  (§8 step 3)
- [ ] **B8·2** [B] — SD logging PR2: RAM ring buffer + dedicated link task
  isolating heartbeat TX from card stalls. deps: B8·1, hardware (to measure real
  stalls). (§7)
- [ ] **D6·tools** [D] — PC-side tools: log decoder (protobuf → DuckDB/CSV/Parquet) +
  fit → `oven_cal.h` emitter. deps: B8·1 log format. *Hardware-independent — can
  start as soon as the format lands.* (§6, §7)

## Wave 6 — Reflow, PCB, connectivity (§8 steps 4–6)

- [ ] **D6·wizard** [D] — calibration-wizard screens. deps: D4, D5. (§20)
- [ ] **D7** [D] — reflow bring-up: PID tuning, calibration runs, drift
  thresholds. deps: D5, D4, D6. (§8 step 4)
- [ ] **D8** [D] — custom PCB (same ESP32 target); move firmware over unchanged,
  re-verify safety on real hardware. deps: D7. (§8 step 5)
- [ ] **D9** [D] — WiFi/OTA (several PRs): HTTP data server; bundle format +
  validation; ESP32 ROM-loader client; `OtaController` state machine
  (host-testable with fakes); OTA wizard screens; partition-fit measurement.
  deps: D6·tools pipeline, hardware, GPIO0/EN control lines wired. (§21, §25, §27; §8 step 6)
